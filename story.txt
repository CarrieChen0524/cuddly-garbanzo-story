It was a rainy day, Ellen is walking on the street in UW campus. She was holding an umbrella but she didn't want to use it. Suddenly, she ran into a person. 

It was her childhood best friend, Claire. They hadn't seen each other for years, but they recognized each other right away. In 4th grade Ellen had moved away from her home town, and her and Claire hadn't seen or talked to each other since that day. They awkwardly greeted each other, and agreed to meet for coffee the next weekend so they could catch up. Ellen stood speechless and Claire, someone she thought she'd never see again, walked away in the rain.

Next weekend rolled around and the meeting was to take place at the local Cuddly Garbanzo. A resturaunt known for its abiltiy to bring friends together. However, this was not to be the case for Ellen and Claire, something unexpected was about to happen at this local hot spot. 

there is only one person in the restaurant when they coming in. The person introduced hismelf as the chief and also boss for the restaurant, and tell them that the restaurant only provide one meal each day. After ordering, Ellen and Claire tried to talk about their childhood to ease the embarrassed atmosphere, but it did not work. They have not seen both for such a long time. Luckily, the meal is ready. After swallowing the spagetti, they suddenly went back to the time that they were only small kids.

They talked so happily that it broke all kinds of awkwardness and it seemed theyare best friends again. After they stepped out the restaurant, holding hands, they realized the magic of the restaurant.
